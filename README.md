# issue-classifier

Classifier for open issues on the `run-llama/llama_index` repository that uses [LlamaClassify](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaclassify/getting_started/) to label issues as `good-first-issue` (suitable for first time contributors).

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.9. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
